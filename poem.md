# For You

In the quiet of the morning light,  
Where dreams and reality meet,  
I find a moment pure and bright,  
Where every heartbeat feels complete.

Through seasons change and years unfold,  
With every step we take together,  
A story beautiful and bold,  
A bond that lasts forever.

So here's to memories we create,  
To laughter, joy, and moments shared,  
To love that knows no bounds or fate,  
To knowing that you've always cared.
