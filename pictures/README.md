# Pictures Directory

This directory is for storing images that will be used in the slideshow background.

## Usage

Add your images to this directory with the following naming convention:
- `image1.jpg`
- `image2.jpg`
- `image3.jpg`
- etc.

The slideshow will automatically detect and cycle through all available images.

## Supported Formats
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP

## Recommendations
- Use high-quality images (at least 1920x1080 for best results)
- Optimize images for web to reduce loading times
- Keep file sizes reasonable (recommended < 500KB per image)

## Fallback
If no images are present, the site will use beautiful gradient backgrounds as a fallback.
